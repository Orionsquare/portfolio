        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>I started my journey learning computer programming when I was 18. The first course I undertook was BASIC programming. This involved learning DOS commands. As computers were not at all popular back in those days (in the late 1980s), I did not progress my course further. Life caught up with me and I eventually went on to study law.</p>
        <p>Things changed for me in 2020 (and I guess it must have changed for many as well!), as the community proceeded through mandatory lockdowns and and thoe who could work from home did. Consequently, I spent a load of time working on my computer. My interest in computer programming was re-ignited.</p>
        <p>I aspire to be an Engineer and I am undertaking Full Stack Engineer Course to achieve my goal.</p>
        <p>Please take a look at my projects in this portfolio.</p>
